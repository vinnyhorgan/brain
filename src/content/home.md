hi! glad you've reached my little corner of the internet :). i am a 21 year old living in italy, i'm into computers, philosophy and poetry. i love minimalism and just "things done right". i am probably a bit weird, i post about the things i do.

here is a quote from feynman:
> what i cannot create, i do not understand.

it's a good summary of my approach to computers and life in general. if you enjoy weird rants, stick around.
