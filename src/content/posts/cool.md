humans. some are cool, some not. but there is one undeniable truth, we are an extremely fascinating species, capable of doing some really insane stuff. i try to appreciate all areas of life, but i'm definitely biased towards anything that has to do with computers.

i've one big problem: i don't store anything. on my computer there is pretty much nothing, all my projects are saved on github and that's about it. i don't have photos, memories of any kind. i dread thinking about how many things i've lost in the past, cause i never made it a habit to save, store, create memories. as a perfectionist, every new idea is better than previous ones.

i recognize this idea barely makes any sense, since all generated ideas are based off previous ones. i have this thing, once something is old, it's not good enough. i want to end this, everything i interact with is part of my journey, i want to document.

here is a list of whatever i think is cool (mostly computer stuff), enjoy.
