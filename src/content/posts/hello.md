i've finally decided, i really want to start this blog. it's something i've been putting off for ages, but with my recent 21'st birthday i've had some time to think. being a perfectionist is not easy, it consumes you from the inside, the need to be perfect every single time makes doing pretty much anything a daunting task.

unfortunately, i've come into contact with computers a few years ago... since then, everything changed. i found an outlet for my perfectionism, i've discovered my deep passion for learning. that question we always had as kids, was my burning fire: "why?".

it brought me down countless "rabbit holes", that kept me going for weeks on end. for what i can remember i've had very few days in the past 5 years where my brain wasn't actively thinking of some problem. see, computer science is perfect for this, all you need is a computer and an internet connection. the entirety of human knowledge is accessible if you know how to look.

i've had time to explore other areas of life, i like being social, training, learning about other things such as history, psychology and so on. i love listening to philosophers, speaking to other people. but i've always had a thing for computers.

don't get me wrong, weird things with computers, raw, bare metal stuff. i've got a fascination for emulators, interpreters. i've had a lot of fun using fantasy consoles and little game engines. my love for minimalism and things that just make sense has always kept me away from the more mainstream stuff like game development with big engines or web development.

i spend way too much time on github, but i can also enjoy a nice long walk. i like to think i can find a balance in my life. one of the objectives i have for this year is to let go a bit more. i always think i am not enough or that i don't have anything to offer to the world. i have a big creativity potential, i feel i want to make stuff, but i always get stuck because of myself.

i want to give this a shot, try to just press that publish button every now and then. i don't have much to show for myself no matter the thousands and thousands of hours i've spent looking at code in my life. i'm full of ideas, some better than others, but i never seem to be able to fully execute on them. maybe having some sort of accountability might help mitigate this...

my dream has always been having a youtube channel, but i've always gotten stuck in the video creation phase since it's something i genuinely don't enjoy doing. but you know what i like doing? writing. i write all the time. i don't think i'm too bad at it... i also like to think i can be a good teacher some day.

well enough ranting for today, i know how to make websites, i like writing, i have stuff to share with the world... welcome to my blog.

PUBLISH!
